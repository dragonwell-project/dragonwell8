//
// Native Monitor-Mutex locking - theory of operations
//
// * Native Monitors are completely unrelated to Java-level monitors,
//   although the "back-end" slow-path implementations share a common lineage.
//   See objectMonitor:: in synchronizer.cpp.
//   Native Monitors do *not* support nesting or recursion but otherwise
//   they're basically Hoare-flavor monitors.
//
// * A thread acquires ownership of a Monitor/Mutex by CASing the LockByte
//   in the _LockWord from zero to non-zero.  Note that the _Owner field
//   is advisory and is used only to verify that the thread calling unlock()
//   is indeed the last thread to have acquired the lock.
//
// * Contending threads "push" themselves onto the front of the contention
//   queue -- called the cxq -- with CAS and then spin/park.
//   The _LockWord contains the LockByte as well as the pointer to the head
//   of the cxq.  Colocating the LockByte with the cxq precludes certain races.
//
// * Using a separately addressable LockByte allows for CAS:MEMBAR or CAS:0
//   idioms.  We currently use MEMBAR in the uncontended unlock() path, as
//   MEMBAR often has less latency than CAS.  If warranted, we could switch to
//   a CAS:0 mode, using timers to close the resultant race, as is done
//   with Java Monitors in synchronizer.cpp.
//
//   See the following for a discussion of the relative cost of atomics (CAS)
//   MEMBAR, and ways to eliminate such instructions from the common-case paths:
//   -- http://blogs.sun.com/dave/entry/biased_locking_in_hotspot
//   -- http://blogs.sun.com/dave/resource/MustangSync.pdf
//   -- http://blogs.sun.com/dave/resource/synchronization-public2.pdf
//   -- synchronizer.cpp
//
// * Overall goals - desiderata
//   1. Minimize context switching
//   2. Minimize lock migration
//   3. Minimize CPI -- affinity and locality
//   4. Minimize the execution of high-latency instructions such as CAS or MEMBAR
//   5. Minimize outer lock hold times
//   6. Behave gracefully on a loaded system
//
// * Thread flow and list residency:
//
//   Contention queue --> EntryList --> OnDeck --> Owner --> !Owner
//   [..resident on monitor list..]
//   [...........contending..................]
//
//   -- The contention queue (cxq) contains recently-arrived threads (RATs).
//      Threads on the cxq eventually drain into the EntryList.
//   -- Invariant: a thread appears on at most one list -- cxq, EntryList
//      or WaitSet -- at any one time.
//   -- For a given monitor there can be at most one "OnDeck" thread at any
//      given time but if needbe this particular invariant could be relaxed.
//
// * The WaitSet and EntryList linked lists are composed of ParkEvents.
//   I use ParkEvent instead of threads as ParkEvents are immortal and
//   type-stable, meaning we can safely unpark() a possibly stale
//   list element in the unlock()-path.  (That's benign).
//
// * Succession policy - providing for progress:
//
//   As necessary, the unlock()ing thread identifies, unlinks, and unparks
//   an "heir presumptive" tentative successor thread from the EntryList.
//   This becomes the so-called "OnDeck" thread, of which there can be only
//   one at any given time for a given monitor.  The wakee will recontend
//   for ownership of monitor.
//
//   Succession is provided for by a policy of competitive handoff.
//   The exiting thread does _not_ grant or pass ownership to the
//   successor thread.  (This is also referred to as "handoff" succession").
//   Instead the exiting thread releases ownership and possibly wakes
//   a successor, so the successor can (re)compete for ownership of the lock.
//
//   Competitive handoff provides excellent overall throughput at the expense
//   of short-term fairness.  If fairness is a concern then one remedy might
//   be to add an AcquireCounter field to the monitor.  After a thread acquires
//   the lock it will decrement the AcquireCounter field.  When the count
//   reaches 0 the thread would reset the AcquireCounter variable, abdicate
//   the lock directly to some thread on the EntryList, and then move itself to the
//   tail of the EntryList.
//
//   But in practice most threads engage or otherwise participate in resource
//   bounded producer-consumer relationships, so lock domination is not usually
//   a practical concern.  Recall too, that in general it's easier to construct
//   a fair lock from a fast lock, but not vice-versa.
//
// * The cxq can have multiple concurrent "pushers" but only one concurrent
//   detaching thread.  This mechanism is immune from the ABA corruption.
//   More precisely, the CAS-based "push" onto cxq is ABA-oblivious.
//   We use OnDeck as a pseudo-lock to enforce the at-most-one detaching
//   thread constraint.
//
// * Taken together, the cxq and the EntryList constitute or form a
//   single logical queue of threads stalled trying to acquire the lock.
//   We use two distinct lists to reduce heat on the list ends.
//   Threads in lock() enqueue onto cxq while threads in unlock() will
//   dequeue from the EntryList.  (c.f. Michael Scott's "2Q" algorithm).
//   A key desideratum is to minimize queue & monitor metadata manipulation
//   that occurs while holding the "outer" monitor lock -- that is, we want to
//   minimize monitor lock holds times.
//
//   The EntryList is ordered by the prevailing queue discipline and
//   can be organized in any convenient fashion, such as a doubly-linked list or
//   a circular doubly-linked list.  If we need a priority queue then something akin
//   to Solaris' sleepq would work nicely.  Viz.,
//   -- http://agg.eng/ws/on10_nightly/source/usr/src/uts/common/os/sleepq.c.
//   -- http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/os/sleepq.c
//   Queue discipline is enforced at ::unlock() time, when the unlocking thread
//   drains the cxq into the EntryList, and orders or reorders the threads on the
//   EntryList accordingly.
//
//   Barring "lock barging", this mechanism provides fair cyclic ordering,
//   somewhat similar to an elevator-scan.
//
// * OnDeck
//   --  For a given monitor there can be at most one OnDeck thread at any given
//       instant.  The OnDeck thread is contending for the lock, but has been
//       unlinked from the EntryList and cxq by some previous unlock() operations.
//       Once a thread has been designated the OnDeck thread it will remain so
//       until it manages to acquire the lock -- being OnDeck is a stable property.
//   --  Threads on the EntryList or cxq are _not allowed to attempt lock acquisition.
//   --  OnDeck also serves as an "inner lock" as follows.  Threads in unlock() will, after
//       having cleared the LockByte and dropped the outer lock,  attempt to "trylock"
//       OnDeck by CASing the field from null to non-null.  If successful, that thread
//       is then responsible for progress and succession and can use CAS to detach and
//       drain the cxq into the EntryList.  By convention, only this thread, the holder of
//       the OnDeck inner lock, can manipulate the EntryList or detach and drain the
//       RATs on the cxq into the EntryList.  This avoids ABA corruption on the cxq as
//       we allow multiple concurrent "push" operations but restrict detach concurrency
//       to at most one thread.  Having selected and detached a successor, the thread then
//       changes the OnDeck to refer to that successor, and then unparks the successor.
//       That successor will eventually acquire the lock and clear OnDeck.  Beware
//       that the OnDeck usage as a lock is asymmetric.  A thread in unlock() transiently
//       "acquires" OnDeck, performs queue manipulations, passes OnDeck to some successor,
//       and then the successor eventually "drops" OnDeck.  Note that there's never
//       any sense of contention on the inner lock, however.  Threads never contend
//       or wait for the inner lock.
//   --  OnDeck provides for futile wakeup throttling a described in section 3.3 of
//       See http://www.usenix.org/events/jvm01/full_papers/dice/dice.pdf
//       In a sense, OnDeck subsumes the ObjectMonitor _Succ and ObjectWaiter
//       TState fields found in Java-level objectMonitors.  (See synchronizer.cpp).
//
// * Waiting threads reside on the WaitSet list -- wait() puts
//   the caller onto the WaitSet.  Notify() or notifyAll() simply
//   transfers threads from the WaitSet to either the EntryList or cxq.
//   Subsequent unlock() operations will eventually unpark the notifyee.
//   Unparking a notifee in notify() proper is inefficient - if we were to do so
//   it's likely the notifyee would simply impale itself on the lock held
//   by the notifier.
//
// * The mechanism is obstruction-free in that if the holder of the transient
//   OnDeck lock in unlock() is preempted or otherwise stalls, other threads
//   can still acquire and release the outer lock and continue to make progress.
//   At worst, waking of already blocked contending threads may be delayed,
//   but nothing worse.  (We only use "trylock" operations on the inner OnDeck
//   lock).
//
// * Note that thread-local storage must be initialized before a thread
//   uses Native monitors or mutexes.  The native monitor-mutex subsystem
//   depends on Thread::current().
//
// * The monitor synchronization subsystem avoids the use of native
//   synchronization primitives except for the narrow platform-specific
//   park-unpark abstraction.  See the comments in os_solaris.cpp regarding
//   the semantics of park-unpark.  Put another way, this monitor implementation
//   depends only on atomic operations and park-unpark.  The monitor subsystem
//   manages all RUNNING->BLOCKED and BLOCKED->READY transitions while the
//   underlying OS manages the READY<->RUN transitions.
//
// * The memory consistency model provide by lock()-unlock() is at least as
//   strong or stronger than the Java Memory model defined by JSR-133.
//   That is, we guarantee at least entry consistency, if not stronger.
//   See http://g.oswego.edu/dl/jmm/cookbook.html.
//
// * Thread:: currently contains a set of purpose-specific ParkEvents:
//   _MutexEvent, _ParkEvent, etc.  A better approach might be to do away with
//   the purpose-specific ParkEvents and instead implement a general per-thread
//   stack of available ParkEvents which we could provision on-demand.  The
//   stack acts as a local cache to avoid excessive calls to ParkEvent::Allocate()
//   and ::Release().  A thread would simply pop an element from the local stack before it
//   enqueued or park()ed.  When the contention was over the thread would
//   push the no-longer-needed ParkEvent back onto its stack.
//
// * A slightly reduced form of ILock() and IUnlock() have been partially
//   model-checked (Murphi) for safety and progress at T=1,2,3 and 4.
//   It'd be interesting to see if TLA/TLC could be useful as well.
//
// * Mutex-Monitor is a low-level "leaf" subsystem.  That is, the monitor
//   code should never call other code in the JVM that might itself need to
//   acquire monitors or mutexes.  That's true *except* in the case of the
//   ThreadBlockInVM state transition wrappers.  The ThreadBlockInVM DTOR handles
//   mutator reentry (ingress) by checking for a pending safepoint in which case it will
//   call SafepointSynchronize::block(), which in turn may call Safepoint_lock->lock(), etc.
//   In that particular case a call to lock() for a given Monitor can end up recursively
//   calling lock() on another monitor.   While distasteful, this is largely benign
//   as the calls come from jacket that wraps lock(), and not from deep within lock() itself.
//
//   It's unfortunate that native mutexes and thread state transitions were convolved.
//   They're really separate concerns and should have remained that way.  Melding
//   them together was facile -- a bit too facile.   The current implementation badly
//   conflates the two concerns.
//
// * TODO-FIXME:
//
//   -- Add DTRACE probes for contended acquire, contended acquired, contended unlock
//      We should also add DTRACE probes in the ParkEvent subsystem for
//      Park-entry, Park-exit, and Unpark.
//
//   -- We have an excess of mutex-like constructs in the JVM, namely:
//      1. objectMonitors for Java-level synchronization (synchronizer.cpp)
//      2. low-level muxAcquire and muxRelease
//      3. low-level spinAcquire and spinRelease
//      4. native Mutex:: and Monitor::
//      5. jvm_raw_lock() and _unlock()
//      6. JVMTI raw monitors -- distinct from (5) despite having a confusingly
//         similar name.

// ON THE VMTHREAD SNEAKING PAST HELD LOCKS:
// In particular, there are certain types of global lock that may be held
// by a Java thread while it is blocked at a safepoint but before it has
// written the _owner field. These locks may be sneakily acquired by the
// VM thread during a safepoint to avoid deadlocks. Alternatively, one should
// identify all such locks, and ensure that Java threads never block at
// safepoints while holding them (_no_safepoint_check_flag). While it
// seems as though this could increase the time to reach a safepoint
// (or at least increase the mean, if not the variance), the latter
// approach might make for a cleaner, more maintainable JVM design.
//
// Sneaking is vile and reprehensible and should be excised at the 1st
// opportunity.  It's possible that the need for sneaking could be obviated
// as follows.  Currently, a thread might (a) while TBIVM, call pthread_mutex_lock
// or ILock() thus acquiring the "physical" lock underlying Monitor/Mutex.
// (b) stall at the TBIVM exit point as a safepoint is in effect.  Critically,
// it'll stall at the TBIVM reentry state transition after having acquired the
// underlying lock, but before having set _owner and having entered the actual
// critical section.  The lock-sneaking facility leverages that fact and allowed the
// VM thread to logically acquire locks that had already be physically locked by mutators
// but where mutators were known blocked by the reentry thread state transition.
//
// If we were to modify the Monitor-Mutex so that TBIVM state transitions tightly
// wrapped calls to park(), then we could likely do away with sneaking.  We'd
// decouple lock acquisition and parking.  The critical invariant  to eliminating
// sneaking is to ensure that we never "physically" acquire the lock while TBIVM.
// An easy way to accomplish this is to wrap the park calls in a narrow TBIVM jacket.
// One difficulty with this approach is that the TBIVM wrapper could recurse and
// call lock() deep from within a lock() call, while the MutexEvent was already enqueued.
// Using a stack (N=2 at minimum) of ParkEvents would take care of that problem.
//
// But of course the proper ultimate approach is to avoid schemes that require explicit
// sneaking or dependence on any any clever invariants or subtle implementation properties
// of Mutex-Monitor and instead directly address the underlying design flaw.
