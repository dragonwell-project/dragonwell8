    /**
     * Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.
     *
     * <p> The Java virtual machine <i>shuts down</i> in response to two kinds
     * of events:
     *
     *   <ul>
     *
     *   <li> The program <i>exits</i> normally, when the last non-daemon
     *   thread exits or when the {@link #exit exit} (equivalently,
     *   {@link System#exit(int) System.exit}) method is invoked, or
     *
     *   <li> The virtual machine is <i>terminated</i> in response to a
     *   user interrupt, such as typing {@code ^C}, or a system-wide event,
     *   such as user logoff or system shutdown.
     *
     *   </ul>
     *
     * <p> A <i>shutdown hook</i> is simply an initialized but unstarted
     * thread.  When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will
     * start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let
     * them run concurrently.  When all the hooks have finished it will then
     * halt. Note that daemon threads will continue to run during the shutdown
     * sequence, as will non-daemon threads if shutdown was initiated by
     * invoking the {@link #exit exit} method.
     *
     * <p> Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by
     * invoking the {@link #halt halt} method, which forcibly
     * terminates the virtual machine.
     *
     * <p> Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a
     * new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook.
     * Attempting either of these operations will cause an
     * {@link IllegalStateException} to be thrown.
     *
     * <p> Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual
     * machine and should therefore be coded defensively.  They should, in
     * particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar
     * as possible.  They should also not rely blindly upon services that may
     * have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in
     * the process of shutting down.  Attempts to use other thread-based
     * services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to
     * deadlocks.
     *
     * <p> Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly.  When a
     * program invokes {@link #exit exit} the expectation is
     * that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit.  When the
     * virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the
     * underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in
     * which to shut down and exit.  It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any
     * user interaction or to perform a long-running computation in a shutdown
     * hook.
     *
     * <p> Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any
     * other thread, by invoking the
     * {@link ThreadGroup#uncaughtException uncaughtException} method of the
     * thread's {@link ThreadGroup} object. The default implementation of this
     * method prints the exception's stack trace to {@link System#err} and
     * terminates the thread; it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or
     * halt.
     *
     * <p> In rare circumstances the virtual machine may <i>abort</i>, that is,
     * stop running without shutting down cleanly.  This occurs when the
     * virtual machine is terminated externally, for example with the
     * {@code SIGKILL} signal on Unix or the {@code TerminateProcess} call on
     * Microsoft Windows.  The virtual machine may also abort if a native
     * method goes awry by, for example, corrupting internal data structures or
     * attempting to access nonexistent memory.  If the virtual machine aborts
     * then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks
     * will be run.
