 * for a locale independent key from a predefined ResourceBundle for the
 * keys defined in this class.
 * <p>The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration
 * of common object roles.  A public constructor for this class has been
 * purposely omitted and applications should use one of the constants
 * from this class.  If the constants in this class are not sufficient
 * to describe the role of an object, a subclass should be generated
 * from this class and it should provide constants in a similar manner.
