# TZdata2024b changes announced on 5th September 2024 includes changes to
# "EST", "MST", and "HST", i.e., changing those time zones from distinct
# time zones to links to other time zones. Previously
# they were defined as fixed offset zones,
# e.g., "EST" is "-05:00" without any DST transitions.
# With 2024b, "EST" is now a link to "America/Panama."
# This change has Java 8+ specification implications in java.time.ZoneId.SHORT_IDS field
# Solution for jdk24+ to modify the mappings in ZoneId class which requires modification of the spec.
# Update releases will not make the ZoneId changes due to current specification.
